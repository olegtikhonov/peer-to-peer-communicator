Declimer:
There are a lot of things are changed since I've done this.
So, currently, before bulding this package, you have to do pre-build steps:
1. download (netty-httptunnel) from https://bitbucket.org/iainmcgin/netty-httptunnel/downloads/
2. change version from 1.0 to 0.92 in its pom.xml file. Why this? Because of lack of support. jxse 2.7 depends on http-tunnel 0.92, and not on 1.0
   mvn clean install
3. on p2p-communicator 
   mvn clean install

Do not know, what is an official status of jxse.
