Story:

As a seller I sell a buity gadget, which put in the action. Buyers could see how it look on them using Virtual Reality.

When they satisfied, they could set a bid. Depending on action type, somebody wins. The winner could pay by PayPal or

using wallet(crypto). When transaction is done, he/she can share delivery address to the seller, or use default.
